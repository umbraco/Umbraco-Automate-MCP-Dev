/**
 * Resolve Step Type Output Schema Tool
 *
 * Computes the JSON output schema a step type would produce for a given
 * configuration. Some step types have a dynamic output schema that depends
 * on their settings (e.g. a database query action's output shape depends on
 * the configured query), so this must be resolved rather than read statically
 * from the catalogue entry.
 *
 * The API answers 200 with a `null` body when the step has no output data -
 * control-flow steps like If and Parallel, or a dynamic step not configured enough
 * to resolve (Run AI Agent with no agent chosen). Passed through as-is, that null
 * becomes missing structuredContent and the MCP client rejects the result, so it
 * is reported as an explicit "no output" result instead.
